#### Why todo-syntax
This extension is a simple and efficient way to highlight and display `TODO`, `FIXME`, and `WARN` syntax in a separate file for a cleaner notes. There are already other extensions that do this, but this extension is not only able to highlight tags, it can also display them in a separate file (which gets automatically created in a new file) which can make it easier for developers to see what needs working on instead of searching through the code to find the tags.
